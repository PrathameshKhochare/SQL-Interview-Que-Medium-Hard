 Scenario-  google interview que
 Q. find the words which are repeating more than once considering all rows of content column

create table namaste_python (
file_name varchar(25),
content varchar(200)
);

delete from namaste_python;

insert into namaste_python values ('python bootcamp1.txt','python for data analytics 0 to hero bootcamp starting on Jan 6th')
,('python bootcamp2.txt','classes will be held on weekends from 11am to 1 pm for 5-6 weeks')
,('python bootcamp3.txt','use code NY2024 to get 33 percent off. You can register from namaste sql website. Link in pinned comment')

-----------------------------------
select * from namaste_python;





-- logic : we have to split given strings by " " and then calculate count(of each record/word)
-- we use string_to_array to split string and unnest string to split based on each word
--- store word in cte and finally count the words > 1

----------------------------------- sql server solution
select value as word , count(value)
from namaste_python
cross apply string_split(content,' ')
group by value
having count(value) > 1

-------------  postgresql - using string_to_array
with cte as(
select file_name , content , unnest(string_to_array(content,' ')) as words
from namaste_python
	)
select words , count(words) as cnt
from cte
group by words
having count(words) > 1
order by cnt desc
