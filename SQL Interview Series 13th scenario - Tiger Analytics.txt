Scenario 13  - Tiger Analytics SQL Interview Question for Data Engineering Position
-- Q. give output in a way that every adult is paired with each child
scripts:
create table family 
(
person varchar(5),
type varchar(10),
age int
);

delete from family ;
insert into family values ('A1','Adult',54)
,('A2','Adult',53),('A3','Adult',52),('A4','Adult',58),('A5','Adult',54),('C1','Child',20),('C2','Child',19),('C3','Child',22),('C4','Child',15);

select * from family



--------------------------------- ans
--(we can create 2 cte's for adult and child and take right 1 char from person column for makinng join between both cte's)
with adult as(
	select * , right(person,1) as a_id from family
	where type = 'Adult'
   )
,child as(
	select * ,right(person,1) as c_id from family
	where type = 'Child'
	)
select a.person, c.person
from adult a
left join child c
on a.a_id = c.c_id
	
---------- now consider a case where every oldest person makes pair with every yongest person
with adult as(
	select * , row_number() over(order by age desc) as rn from family
	where type = 'Adult'
   )
,child as(
	select * ,row_number() over(order by age ) as rn from family
	where type = 'Child'
	)
select a.person , a.age , c.person , c.age
from adult a 
left join child c
on a.rn = c.rn
