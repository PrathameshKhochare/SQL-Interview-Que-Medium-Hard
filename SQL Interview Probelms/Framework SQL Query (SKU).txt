--here is the script:
create table sku 
(
sku_id int,
price_date date ,
price int
);
delete from sku;

insert into sku values 
(1,'2023-01-01',10)
,(1,'2023-02-15',15)
,(1,'2023-03-03',18)
,(1,'2023-03-27',15)
,(1,'2023-04-06',20)

select * from sku

-------- Ans
-- we need to find 1st date of next month ,if price_date is not an 1st date of current_month

-- for price_date = 1st date , we will filter out that records
select * from sku where extract(day from price_date) = 1

-- also if there are diff price for same month, then we have to consider the latest price
-- for this we  use ranking and store in cte and filter only records with latest price_date
-- we will use date_trunc over next_month to get 1st date of next month
-- alse we will consider, the 1st date price records shouldn't consider in date_trunc of next_month
with cte as (
select * , row_number() over(partition by sku_id, extract(year from price_date) ,  extract(month from price_date) order by price_date desc ) as rn
from sku
	)
,final_cte as (
select sku_id , price_date , price  from sku where extract(day from price_date) = 1
union all
select sku_id , date_trunc('month',price_date + interval '1 month')::date as first_day_next_mnt ,price
from cte where rn = 1 and  date_trunc('month',price_date + interval '1 month')::date not in (select price_date from sku where extract(day from price_date) = 1)
	)
select * , price - lag(price,1,price) over(order by price_date) as diff
