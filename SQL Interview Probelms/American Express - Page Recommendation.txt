/* we 1st create sep ctes for user_likes and friend_likes . as we have to ommite page_ids of users_like from friend_likes cte
we will left join friend_likes with user_likes on user_id and page_id , and apply where condition for null values for user_likes cte 
( as null denotes user has already liked page , so we can recommend remaining pages for that users)
