*/

Here is the ready script:
create table paypal_emp(
emp_id int,
emp_name varchar(20),
department_id int,
salary int,
manager_id int,
emp_age int);

insert into paypal_emp
values
(1, 'Ankit', 100,10000, 4, 39);
insert into paypal_emp
values (2, 'Mohit', 100, 15000, 5, 48);
insert into paypal_emp
values (3, 'Vikas', 100, 10000,4,37);
insert into paypal_emp
values (4, 'Rohit', 100, 5000, 2, 16);
insert into paypal_emp
values (5, 'Mudit', 200, 12000, 6,55);
insert into paypal_emp
values (6, 'Agam', 200, 12000,2, 14);
insert into paypal_emp
values (7, 'Sanjay', 200, 9000, 2,13);
insert into paypal_emp

insert into paypal_emp
values (10, 'Rakesh',300,7000,6,50);

select * from paypal_emp

---- ans  logic - : avg = sum(dept_salary)/count(emp)
-- as we have to exclude curr_dept while calculating overall_company_avg_sal , we can store count(emp) and sum(salary) for each dept along with avg_sal of each dept in cte
-- we use self join , with join on dept_id not equal to curr_dept_id , and calculate avg_company_sal by sum(sal) / count(emp) grouped on dept
-- finally filter the records on condition overall_sal >= dept_sal
with cte as (
	select department_id , round(avg(salary)) as avg_sal , count(emp_id) as dept_emp_cnt , sum(salary) as total_dept_salary
	from paypal_emp
	group by department_id
)
select c1.department_id , max(c1.avg_sal) as dept_avg_sal , round(sum(c2.total_dept_salary) / sum(c2.dept_emp_cnt)) as dept_avg_salary_excluding_current_dep
from cte c1
join cte c2
on c1.department_id != c2.department_id
group by  c1.department_id --,  c1.avg_sal 
having  round(sum(c2.total_dept_salary) / sum(c2.dept_emp_cnt)) >= max(c1.avg_sal)
order by c1.department_id
