/* Q. 26 - Lowest Token Number
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given table contains tokens taken by different customers in a tax office.
Write a SQL query to return the lowest token number which is unique to a customer (meaning token should be allocated to just a single customer).
*/

drop table if exists tokens;
create table tokens
(
	token_num	int,
	customer	varchar(20)
);
insert into tokens values(1, 'Maryam');
insert into tokens values(2, 'Rocky');
insert into tokens values(3, 'John');
insert into tokens values(3, 'John');
insert into tokens values(2, 'Arya');
insert into tokens values(1, 'Pascal');
insert into tokens values(9, 'Kate');
insert into tokens values(9, 'Ibrahim');
insert into tokens values(8, 'Lilly');
insert into tokens values(8, 'Lilly');
insert into tokens values(5, 'Shane');

select * from tokens;


-------- ans
-- giving rank for tokens shared by customers , totaken no 3 and 8 are shared by single customer and hence they both have same rank
with cte as(
select * , rank() over(partition by token_num order by customer) as rn
from tokens
)
select token_num --, min(customer) as customer
from cte 
where rn  = 1
group by token_num
having count(customer) > 1
limit 1

---------- or
--------- select distinct * from tokens order by token_num -> will gives unique records , which only takes 1 record for same cust who shared same token_no
select token_num --, count(token_num)
from (select distinct * from tokens order by token_num)t
group by token_num
having  count(customer) = 1
limit 1
