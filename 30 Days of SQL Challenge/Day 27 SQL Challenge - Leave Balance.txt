/* Q- 27 Leave Balance
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Given vacation_plans tables shows the vacations applied by each employee during the year 2024. 
Leave_balance table has the available leaves for each employee.
Write an SQL query to determine if the vacations applied by each employee can be approved or not based on the available leave balance. 
If an employee has enough available leaves then mention the status as "Approved" else mention "Insufficient Leave Balance".
Assume there are no public holidays during 2024. weekends (sat & sun) should be excluded while calculating vacation days.

------------- 1st calculate total working days (excluding sat-sun)
--- we can calculate vacation_days by using generate_series between from_dt and to_dt and excluding saturday and sunday from it
-- using group by, we can calculate vacation_days betwn from_dt and to_dt
-- to get if leave_balance - vacation_days > 0 , means sufficient leave balance and vice versa , we use recursive cte , by numbering emp with multiple leave records
---  as base query -: emp with 1st leave records , and iterating prev_balance - vacation_days to check for sufficient leave balance left or not for multiple leave records

------------- using recursive cte
with recursive cte as (
	with cte_data as (
		select id , v.emp_id , from_dt , to_dt , l.balance , count(dates) as vacation_days
		,row_number() over(partition by v.emp_id order by v.emp_id , v.id) as rn
		from vacation_plans v
		cross join lateral
		( select cast(dates as date) as dates ,trim(to_char(dates,'day')) as day_ 
		from generate_series(v.from_dt ,v.to_dt,'1 day') as dates) d
	join leave_balance l on l.emp_id = v.emp_id
