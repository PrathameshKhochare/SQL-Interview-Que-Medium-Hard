-- Scenario 6 - Datalemur - photoshop revenue analysis
--Q. for every customer that bought photoshop, return a list of customers and total spend on all the products except for photoshop prod


create table adobe_transactions(customer_id int, product varchar(25), revenue int);

insert into adobe_transactions values
(123,'Photoshop',50),(123,'Premier Pro',100),(123,'After Effects',50),(234,'Illustrator',200),(234,'Premier Pro',100);

select * from adobe_transactions;

/* logic - as we have to 1st select all records where product is photoshop 
, and within this we further calculate sum(revenue) where product is other than photoshop
1.we can use subquery to get all records for photoshop and on basis of this we calculate sum(revenue) for other products
2. we can use exist operator too.

------------------------------------- using exist operator
select customer_id ,sum(revenue)
from adobe_transactions a
where exists
(select 1
from adobe_transactions b
where product = 'Photoshop'
and  a.customer_id = b.customer_id)
and product != 'Photoshop'
group by customer_id

-------------------------------- using subquery
select customer_id ,sum(revenue)
from adobe_transactions
where customer_id in (select customer_id from adobe_transactions where product = 'Photoshop') and product != 'Photoshop'
group by customer_id
