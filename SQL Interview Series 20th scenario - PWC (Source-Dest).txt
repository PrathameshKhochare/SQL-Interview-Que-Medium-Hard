Scenario 20 -- PWC sql interview que
Q. we have to print mismatching records and commenting as per output

create table source(id int, name varchar(5))

create table target(id int, name varchar(5))

insert into source values(1,'A'),(2,'B'),(3,'C'),(4,'D')

insert into target values(1,'A'),(2,'B'),(4,'X'),(5,'F');

output -
-- id   comment
    3   new in source
    4   mismatch
    5   new in target

select * from source
select * from target
---------------------------- ans

select coalesce(s.id,t.id) as id
, case when t.name is null then 'new in source'
       when s.name is null then 'new in dest'
	   when s.name != t.name then 'mismatch' end as comment

from source s
full outer join target t
on s.id = t.id
where s.name is null or t.name is null or s.name != t.name



-- first we will join tables on id with full outer join
--we can crete new column using case when statement 
------------------------------ with full join
with cte as(
select coalesce(s.id,t.id) as id ,s.name as name , t.id as id1 , t.name as name1
from source s
full outer join target t
on s.id = t.id 
where s.name is null or t.name is null or s.name != t.name
	)
select id,
case when name1 is null then 'new in source' when name is null then 'new in target' when name1 != name then 'mismatch' end as comment

from cte
--where name != name1 or name is null or name1 is null


-- 1st union all records from source and target as table_ as new column for making diff
-- then calculate aggregation like count(id) , min(name) , max(name) ,min(table_) , max(table_) for comaparing and filtering reords
-- then use case when statement to filter as per required output
--------------------------- union all
with cte as(
select * ,'source' as table_ from source
union all
select * ,'target' as table_ from target
)
,cte2 as(
select id ,count(name) as total_cnt 
,min(name) as name_min , max(name) as name_max , min(table_) as table_min , max(table_) as table_max
from cte

order by id)
select id , case when name_min = name_max and table_min = 'source' then 'new in source' 
                 when name_min = name_max and table_min = 'target' then 'new in target'
				 else 'mismatch' end as comment
from cte2
where name_min != name_max or table_min = table_max

--------------------------- union all (simplified)
with cte as(
select * ,'source' as table_ from source
union all
select * ,'target' as table_ from target
)

select id ,count(name) as total_cnt ,min(name) as name_min , max(name) as name_max , min(table_) as table_min , max(table_) as table_max
, case when min(name) != max(name) then 'mismatch' when min(table_) = 'source' then 'new in source' else 'new in target' end as comment
from cte
group by id
having count(name) = 1 or (min(name) != max(name))
