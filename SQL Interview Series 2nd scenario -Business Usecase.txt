PostgreSQL
----------------------------- Ans - with out considering holiday on weekend
with holiday_cal as(
select *, (resolved_date - create_date) as actual_days , 
extract('week' from resolved_date) -  extract('week' from create_date) as week_diff
from tickets t
left join holidays h
on h.holiday_date between t.create_date and t.resolved_date
)
select create_date , resolved_date , (resolved_date - create_date - 2*week_diff - count(reason)) as business_days
from holiday_cal
group by create_date , resolved_date ,week_diff



------now take considerarion of scenario if holiday comes on weekends

select create_date ,resolved_date , (resolved_date - create_date - 2*week_diff -count(holiday_date)) as bus_days
from
(
select *, (resolved_date - create_date) as actual_days , 
extract('week' from resolved_date) -  extract('week' from create_date) as week_diff
,to_char(h.holiday_date,'day')	as day_
--,case when to_char(h.holiday_date,'day') in ('sunday','saturday') then 1 else 0 end as holiday_on_weekend
from tickets t
left join holidays h
on h.holiday_date between t.create_date and t.resolved_date
--and (TO_CHAR(holiday_date, 'Day') not in  ('saturday', 'sunday'))
and extract (dow from h.holiday_date) not in (0,6)
)a
group by create_date ,resolved_date ,week_diff
